Overview
- The SHADE Protocol is a simple, header-driven data exchange system. It focuses on delivering arbitrary payloads with a compact, well-defined frame layout. The design emphasizes low overhead, predictable performance, and straightforward multiplexing of multiple logical channels over a single physical link.
- This repository provides a reference implementation and a living specification. It targets environments where resources are limited but reliability matters. The protocol is suitable for devices that expose a character-oriented interface, such as serial ports, USB-serial bridges, or custom I/O buses that resemble a character device.

Why this project exists
- In many embedded and edge contexts, raw byte streams lack structure. A clean framing scheme with a small header makes it easy to build robust communication between hosts and devices.
- SHADE supports multiple logical sessions over the same link. It enables multiplexing without expensive negotiation or heavy orchestration.
- The protocol is designed to be easy to understand and easy to implement. It minimizes surprises in edge cases and provides clear outcomes for error conditions.

Key ideas and goals
- Simplicity first: a small, fixed header per frame, plus a payload. No heavy cryptography by default, but the design accommodates optional authentication and integrity checks.
- Predictable overhead: a fixed-size frame header ensures a known minimum cost per message. Payload length is explicit, enabling efficient buffering strategies.
- Multiplexing through channels: each frame carries a channel identifier. This lets multiple data streams share a single transport without cross-talk.
- Session management: sessions group a sequence of frames that belong to a single logical conversation. Sessions have lifetimes, timeouts, and can be suspended or resumed.
- Deterministic handling: frames can be acknowledged, retried, or flagged as errors in a clear, deterministic way.

Design principles and philosophy
- Clarity over cleverness. The frame layout is intentionally straightforward.
- Portability. The reference implementation aims to compile on common toolchains and operating systems.
- Extensibility. The header includes fields that can be extended to support future features without breaking compatibility.
- Robustness. The protocol defines predictable behavior for common error scenarios, including corrupted frames, out-of-order delivery, and invalid sessions.

Terminology and concepts
- Frame: A unit of data exchanged over the transport. Each frame has a header, optional payload, and a trailing checksum.
- Header: A compact collection of fields that describe the frame. The header is fixed in size, enabling fast parsing.
- Payload: The actual data carried by the frame. Its length is declared in the header.
- Channel: A logical lane identified by a numeric value. Channels multiplex multiple conversations on the same link.
- Session: A grouping of frames that belong to a single logical interaction. Sessions have a lifecycle and state.
- Checksum: A value that helps detect data corruption. The reference implementation uses CRC-32 for integrity checks.
- Preamble: A pair of bytes used to identify the start of a frame. It helps align frames in a stream.
- Version: The protocol version. The value distinguishes major protocol revisions.

Reference architecture and layering
- Link layer: The underlying transport (for example, a serial port) that carries bytes in and out.
- Frame layer: The SHADE framing logic. It handles framing, parsing, and basic validation (preamble, version, length, checksum).
- Session layer: Manages sessions, including creation, termination, and keep-alive semantics.
- Channel layer: Manages multiplexed channels. Each channel is a separate data path with its own sequencing and flow control rules.
- Application layer: The user’s code that uses SHADE to exchange header-bearing data with low overhead.

Frame format and frame fields (practical details)
- Preamble: 2 bytes. A fixed sequence used to mark the start of each frame. Example: 0x55 0xAA.
- Version: 1 byte. For v1.3, this is typically 0x03.
- Flags: 1 byte. Reserved for future use. Currently, set to 0x00 unless a feature is requested.
- Session ID: 2 bytes. Identifies the logical session this frame belongs to. Values range from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.
- Channel: 1 byte. Identifies the logical channel within the session. Enables multiplexing multiple streams.
- Type: 1 byte. Indicates the kind of frame. Common types include DATA (0x01) and ACK (0x02). Other types may be added in future versions.
- Sequence: 2 bytes. A monotonically increasing counter used for ordering and reliability.
- Length: 2 bytes. The length of the payload in bytes.
- Payload: N bytes. The data carried by the frame. N must be exactly the value given in Length.
- CRC: 4 bytes. CRC-32 of the frame header and payload, excluding the CRC itself.

ASCII representation of a sample frame
- Frame type: DATA
- Frame payload: 4 bytes of data
- Example frame (hex): 55 AA 03 00 00 01 01 01 00 01 00 04 DE AD BE EF 1A 2B 3C 4D

- Explanation:
  - 55 AA: Preamble
  - 03: Version
  - 00: Flags
  - 00 01: Session ID (0x0001)
  - 01: Channel (0x01)
  - 01: Type (DATA)
  - 00 01: Sequence (0x0001)
  - 00 04: Length (4 bytes)
  - DE AD BE EF: Payload
  - 1A 2B 3C 4D: CRC-32

Additional sample: an ACK frame
- Frame type: ACK
- Example frame (hex): 55 AA 03 00 00 01 01 02 00 01 00 00 AB CD 12 34

- Explanation:
  - The ACK frame mirrors the header structure but uses Type 0x02 and zero-length payload.
  - CRC is still required to validate the entire frame.

Multiplexing and channel semantics
- A single link can carry multiple logical conversations by using channels. Each channel has its own data flow and sequencing semantics.
- Channels are identified by a 1-byte value. Values 0x00 and 0x01 are common defaults; higher values are reserved for future expansion.
- Applications should not rely on a fixed channel count. They can dynamically allocate channels per session as long as channel IDs remain unique within the session.
- A channel can be idle, with only background keep-alive frames or control frames exchanged to maintain session health.

Session management and lifecycle
- Sessions are created by an initiating host and assigned a session ID. The session ID remains valid for the life of the session.
- Sessions have a time-to-live (TTL) and may require periodic keep-alive frames to avoid timeout.
- If a session becomes inactive or encounters an unrecoverable error, the session enters a CLOSED state and resources are released.
- Reconnecting a session after a disconnect should use a new or re-established session ID, depending on the application needs and policy.

Checksum and data integrity
- CRC-32 is the primary integrity check. It protects the header and payload (the CRC does not cover itself).
- CRC-32 is computed over the serialized header (excluding the CRC field) concatenated with the payload.
- If a frame fails CRC verification, it is discarded, and the receiver may respond with an error or send an ACK/NACK depending on the protocol mode.
- For critical applications, you can layer an authentication tag (e.g., HMAC) on top of SHADE frames by placing it in the payload, provided both ends agree on the format and size.

Error handling, reliability, and recovery
- CRC mismatch: Frame is discarded. Optional: send an error frame back to the sender with a NACK type (0x03) and the sequence number.
- Out-of-order frames: Use the Sequence field to detect gaps. The receiver can request retransmission by sending a NACK for the missing range.
- Lost frames: Timeouts trigger retransmission if the channel or session supports reliable delivery modes. Applications can implement their own acknowledgment strategies on top of SHADE if needed.
- Corrupted payload: The CRC detects corruption. The frame is dropped; the sender may retransmit depending on the reliability policy.
- Session timeouts: Keep-alive frames prevent timeouts. A lack of keep-alives may cause the session to be closed automatically by the receiver.

Security and threat considerations
- By default, SHADE focuses on reliability and low overhead. It does not mandate encryption or authentication.
- You can layer security on top by using an authenticated channel: wrap the SHADE transport with TLS or implement per-frame HMACs appended to the payload.
- The frame header is not encrypted by default; sensitive data should be protected by higher-layer security when available.
- If you enable persistent sessions across untrusted links, implement binding to endpoints and mutual authentication at the transport layer.

Getting started: building and running the reference
- The repository ships with a reference implementation and a clear build path. You can target common toolchains such as GCC, Clang, and Rust.
- Prerequisites
  - A modern C/C++ toolchain (GCC or Clang) or Rust toolchain (rustc and cargo)
  - Basic build tools (make or cmake)
  - A serial port or virtual serial port if you want to test cross-device behavior
- Building the C/C++ reference
  - Install a C/C++ toolchain
  - From the repository root, run make or cmake to generate build files
  - Build a default target to produce the reference executable
- Building the Rust reference
  - Install Rust toolchain
  - Run cargo build --release
  - The compiled binary will be placed in the target/release directory
- Running a simple test
  - Start a pair of processes on the same host or across devices with a connected serial interface
  - Open two terminal windows and run the reference executable in each with matching session setup
  - Use one window to send a DATA frame and the other to receive and acknowledge
- Basic usage notes
  - The frame layout is designed for speed. It minimizes parsing overhead by keeping the header compact and predictable.
  - The payload may be any binary data. Do not assume the presence of null-terminated strings unless the application-layer protocol defines it explicitly.
  - When testing, consider enabling verbose logging to observe frame boundaries and CRC checks.

  - Preamble: 2 bytes (0x55 0xAA)
  - Version: 1 byte (0x03 for v1.3)
  - Flags: 1 byte
  - Session ID: 2 bytes
  - Channel: 1 byte
  - Type: 1 byte
  - Sequence: 2 bytes
  - Length: 2 bytes
  - Payload: variable
  - CRC: 4 bytes
- Byte order
  - All multi-byte fields (Session ID, Sequence, Length) use big-endian (network) order
- Data framing example
  - See the sample frames above for DATA and ACK frames
- Channel and session management
  - Channels multiplex data paths
  - Sessions organize related frames into meaningful conversations
  - Keep-alive and timeout semantics help devices recover from transient failures

Usage patterns and practical considerations
- Serial link usage
  - SHADE works well on UART-like connections. Use a robust driver with proper buffering to avoid loss during bursts
  - If you have flow control hardware, consider using it to avoid buffer overruns
- USB-serial bridges
  - Many devices expose a USB serial interface. Treat the link like a virtual COM port
  - Ensure your host and device share a common baud rate and timing assumptions
- Networking use cases
  - While SHADE targets serial-like channels, it can be adapted to other byte streams with minor adjustments in the transport layer
  - In such cases, ensure frame boundaries remain intact and CRC checks are enabled
- Debugging tips
  - Enable verbose log levels to see byte streams and frame boundaries
  - Validate frames using hex dumps to confirm correct preamble, header, payload, and CRC
  - Use the sample frames provided in this document to test a minimal loopback

Data formats and payload handling
- The payload is arbitrary binary data. The protocol imposes no restrictions on its content.
- If the application needs structured data, define an application-layer schema and store it in the payload
  - For example, you can serialize a small TLV (type-length-value) structure inside the payload
  - Ensure the payload length matches the Length field precisely
- Payload alignment
  - The protocol requires exact Length alignment with the payload. No padding is added unless the application layer requires it

Security best practices for SHADE
- If you operate in a trusted environment, you may rely on the transport layer for security
- For sensitive data, consider wrapping the transport with encryption (TLS) or appending cryptographic checksums
- Do not expose frame headers to untrusted networks if you rely on confidentiality
- Ensure you implement proper authentication and authorization if SHADE frames traverse untrusted hosts

Testing and quality assurance
- Unit tests cover frame serialization and deserialization
- Integration tests exercise end-to-end messaging across a simulated link
- Fuzz testing helps uncover mistakes in framing logic and boundary conditions
- Performance tests measure framing throughput, latency, and CPU usage under load
- Reproducible test environments help track down intermittent issues

Examples and practical demonstrations
- Example 1: Simple data transfer on a single channel
  - Open a session with ID 0x0001
  - Create Channel 0x01
  - Send a DATA frame with a small payload
  - Expect an ACK in response
- Example 2: Multiplexed streams
  - Use Channel 0x01 and Channel 0x02 to carry two independent payloads
  - Each channel has its own sequence and keeps alignment clean
  - The receiver handles frames for both channels independently
- Example 3: Session keep-alive
  - After establishing a session, periodically send keep-alive frames
  - If a keep-alive is missed, consider a reconnect on the higher layer
- Example 4: Error handling and recovery
  - Simulate a corrupted frame (CRC mismatch) and verify rejection behavior
  - Test a missing frame and ensure the receiver can request a retransmission if desired

Examples of real-world workflows
- Embedded sensor networks
  - A central hub uses SHADE to collect sensor data from multiple devices
  - Each sensor uses its own channel, with a separate sequence per device
  - Data payloads can be compressed to save bandwidth; the protocol does not mandate compression
- Inter-process communication on a single host
  - Two processes communicate through a loopback device or a virtual serial link
  - The session represents a logical conversation between the processes
  - Channels separate control messages from data streams
- Debugging and diagnostics
  - Tools can generate frames to test error paths, such as CRC failures or invalid session IDs
  - Observability features help diagnose frame drops and misordered sequences
